# So you wanna be a better coder?
Clean Code Saver is a simple screen saver that shows you the principles and practices from the great book *Clean Code*
written by Robert C. Martin. You are no coder? Don't stop reading! Even if Clean Code Saver is primarily targeted at
coders, the shown texts are fully customizable - so you could configure Clean Code Saver to display i. e. important
phone numbers for new employees or something like that.

# Do not expect too much eye candy!
Clean Code Saver is not indended to give you a breath taking graphical experience. Instead, Clean Code Saver will
show you some texts again and again and again - and hopefully it will help you to not forget what you've read.
